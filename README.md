# Compute-e
This program compute e. The calculation of the important mathematical constant e, base of the natural logarithms frequently done as the sum of the infinite Taylor Series:
          ∞
    e = ∑   1/n!
         n=0

Output will show the computed value for e, the math.h library constant expected value for e and the number of terms it took to reach ten significant digit accuracy.

To use this program
--------------------
1- On the terminal, navigate to where the eCalc.c file is.

2- Run "gcc eCalc.c -o eCalc.out” to compile the program.

3- Then run "./eCalc.out” to execute the program.

4- The result will be displayed on the screen.
